# Engine-Emission-Combustion-Project
This project is a Predictive Maintenance &amp; Combustion Analysis System designed for internal combustion engines. It collects engine operating parameters (e.g., rotational speed, compression ratio, temperatures, torque, fuel consumption, exhaust composition) and uses a trained machine learning model to predict performance and emissions behavior.
